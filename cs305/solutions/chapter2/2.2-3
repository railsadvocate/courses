On average, the number of elements needed to search through before finding the element you are looking for would be half the number of the elements to search through. In other words, for an array of size n, you would need to search, on average, n/2 elements before finding the element you are looking for. In the worst case, the element you are looking for would be the last element in the array, and would therefore require you to search the entire array to find it. The average case and worst case running times for this linear search would be O(N). Even though the average case only has you searching through n/2 elements, n/2 is still a function of the input size n.
