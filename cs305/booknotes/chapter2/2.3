- The divide and conquer paradigm involves three steps at each level of the recursion:
	1. Divide the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
	2. Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straigtforward manner
	3. Combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
- The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide and conquer paradigm. 
- The recurrence equation goes as follows:
	T(n) = {Ã¸(1)			if n <= c
		aT(n/b) + C(n) + D(n)	otherwise
	       } 
	T(n) = running time of a problem of size n
	a    = number of subproblems at each step
	1/b  = size of each subproblem
	D(n) = time needed for divide step of n elements
	C(n) = time needed for combine step on n elements
- you can think of the 'aT(n/b)' as the time needed for the conquer step
